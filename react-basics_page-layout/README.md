## Challenge: Create a Basic Website Layout

In this challenge, you will be creating a basic website layout using React. You need to implement JSX code for three components - `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`. Additionally, you need to render these components within the `App` component.

### Instructions:

1. Open the provided `App.js` file.
2. Now it is your time to be creative! Implement the JSX code within each function according to its name:

   - In the `Header` function, write down your JSX code that represents a header section of a website. Make sure to use appropriate CSS classes from the provided `Header.css` file.
   - In the `MainContent` function, write down your JSX code that represents the main content section of a website. Use relevant CSS classes from the provided `MainContent.css` file.
   - In the `Footer` function, write down your JSX code that represents a footer section of a website. Utilize suitable CSS classes from the provided `Footer.css` file.

3. Finally, render these components within the App by implementing necessary JSX code inside it. Do not forget that when you want to return multiple JSX elements from a function, you need to wrap them in a single parent element, e.g. `<div className="app-container">...</div>`.

4. Save all changes made to `App.js`.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
